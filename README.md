# AI Influencer Studio

This is a vibe-coding project using Google AI Studio to support part of my MPhil application. Also inspired by Your Average Tech Bro (@YourAverageTechBro) and his app Yorby, I built this app without a viral-reel database to make it a bit handy. However, one of the greatest falls in this app AI search is not very accurate at all. I also highly recommend checking out Yorby, the social media marketing tool for startups: https://www.yorby.ai.
